Respected Sir,


I am writing this application to inform you that I am in need of 2 full day leaves on 29th of February and 7th of March(thursday and thursday) and 2 half day leaves on 28th of February and 5th of March (wednesday and tuesday) because of practical examinations.

I am asking half day leave for 28th of February because I have to make hardcopy of my project and seminar report and then submit in the college.
I hope that you will take my application under your kind consideration and will grant me leave.

The timetable issued for the practical examination is attached with this email.

I shall be very thankful to you for this kind favor.




Yours sincerely
Dipendra Bogati.
